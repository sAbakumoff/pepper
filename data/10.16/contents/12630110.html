Reflect | Senior Software Engineers | Portland, OR | ONSITE<p>We&#x2019;re looking to add experienced software engineers to our team to help build, scale, and manage our hosted and on-prem platforms. Engineers in these roles will help define much of the technical direction of Reflect. You&#x2019;ll get to work with everyone on our small team and wear lots of different hats, both technical and non-technical.</p><p>Reflect is considered infrastructure by our customers so service availability is extremely important to our business. We all practice DevOps and we deploy our stack amongst many different cloud providers. We&#x2019;re golang on the backend and ES6/React on the front end with some services and tools written in Ruby.</p><p>Reflect is the API for data visualization, solving the data visualization problem for developers the way Twilio solves communication, Stripe solves payments, and Sendgrid solves email: by making it a service. With Reflect, developers can add data visualization to their web and mobile applications in minutes.</p><p>email me: brad@reflect.io or checkout our postings at <a href="http://bit.ly/1VwMy4z" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/1VwMy4z</a><span>
