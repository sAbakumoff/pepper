Those aren&apos;t the same person, mind you. We&apos;re also looking for electrical engineers and mechanical engineers.</p><p>You do <i>NOT</i> need any robotics experience - I had none when I joined!</p><p>Check out our careers site and email me if anything looks interesting: <a href="http://www.irobot.com/About-iRobot/Careers.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.irobot.com/About-iRobot/Careers.aspx</a></p><p>Please email me at csvec, the at sign, then the company domain.<span>
