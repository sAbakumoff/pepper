You&apos;re a crack-shot in your back-end language of choice. Our system matches users with hundreds of possible opportunities in real-time. Needless to say, we&apos;re looking for people who care about performance. A lot. Our back-end systems are written in C#, Java using Redis, Mongo, and SQLServer. You might know C# or Java or you might not, but either way you&apos;re willing to learn. Regardless, you can impress us in your language of choice. If you&apos;re a Senior Engineer - you&apos;ve worked in server-side code for a few years. You&apos;ve scaled to thousands or maybe millions of users. If you&apos;re a Junior engineer, you love to code and you&apos;re good at it. You&apos;re smart, you&apos;re passionate, and most of all you can&apos;t wait to get started. (New grads please apply!)</p><p>Front-end Engineers:
You know Javascript. You know the ins, the outs and how to make it blazing fast. You care about performance because you know your users are waiting for every line of your code. You&apos;ve used some popular frameworks, maybe angular or react - but you know one or more cold.</p><p>Project Managers:
Keeping a small bunch of plates spinning all at once is your specialty. 2+ years as a project manager for technology teams in agile, scrum, kanban, waterfall, or your own thoughts on &quot;just the good bits&quot; from the aforementioned (we&apos;d love to hear them!).</p><p>Wordpress Engineers:
You know Wordpress inside and out. You&apos;ve built big sites with custom features that you can show us.</p><p>Where we are:</p><p>Charlotte, NC:
If you&apos;re into great weather and a central location (our airport is an American hub) you should check us out. You can pick great urban living (Uptown&apos;s 4th ward is the place to be) or get yourself a huge house (at reasonable prices) in the burbs. The standard of living for an engineer doesn&apos;t get any better than this.<span>
