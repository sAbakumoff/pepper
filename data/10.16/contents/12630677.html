Janelia Research Campus | Ashburn, VA (next to Wash DC) | Full-Time | ONSITE | Computer Vision Research<p>We&apos;re a research team trying to decipher the connectivity of neurons in a fly brain using nanometer-resolution 3D electron microscopy imaging developed within our group.  The FlyEM Project is a part of Janelia (<a href="http://www.janelia.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.janelia.org</a>), a world-class neuroscience research institute that is an extraordinarily beautiful place to work (<a href="http://prometheus.med.utah.edu/~bwjones/2014/04/janelia-farm/" rel="nofollow">http://prometheus.med.utah.edu/~bwjones/2014/04/janelia-farm...</a>) and learn.  If you want to do cutting-edge computer research and help figure out how brains work, come join our team.</p><p>Job posting: <a href="https://goo.gl/BYv31K" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/BYv31K</a></p><p>We are also looking for great programmers interested in data processing and storage (Spark, Go/C++/Python, Image Processing).
