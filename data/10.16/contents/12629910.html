Our Quality, Process, and Market Intelligence services create real-time predictive decisions metrics at each stage of a products life-cycle. We leverage our predictive models across products &amp; industries for flavor profile optimization, production process optimization, demographic targeting &amp; cognitive marketing - helping companies create and sell the best product to their highest value consumers with every batch.</p><p>Our Services</p><p>_Quality Intelligence_: Real-time predictive quality control, assurance, and improvement from human sensory data.</p><p>_Process Intelligence_: Real-time predictive process control and optimization from human sensory data + manufacturing &amp; LIMS data.</p><p>_Market Intelligence_: Linking flavor-profile, demographics, and sales data to find the highest value consumer demographics for a product&apos;s flavor-profile.</p><p>The Position(s)</p><p>_Engineering_: Web-application or Streaming Infrastructure focused full-stack engineer capable of integrating the data pipeline and outputs of machine learning models into an easy to use management platform.</p><p>_Data Science_: Data science is central to our predictive Quality, Process, and Market Intelligence services. We didn&#x2019;t build a data science team to optimize our product&apos;s marketing spend, sales funnel, or client retention &#x2013; we built a data science team to build our product. We need data scientists who can understand our clients and can take a nebulous business goal, create a set of quantitative decision metrics, and build predictive models to optimize those metrics.</p><p>The extensive role of data scientists at Analytical Flavor Systems allows us to invest in their education across sensory perception (standard sensory science so they know what we&#x2019;re improving and replacing), tasting experiences (so they appreciate the products we work on and understand how the data is collected), production knowledge (test batches in our R&amp;D brewery and roastery so they understand the data they work with and how our predictions impact a client&#x2019;s process), and data science tear-downs (a meeting where the team collaboratively attempts to find and fix problems, try new techniques, and debate the philosophical implications of a model&apos;s construction).</p><p>_Sales_: We prefer the thoughtful relationship builder to the cowboy negotiator. Most of our contracts are multi-year high-price affairs, so relationships are really important. Plus, you get to spend your time at breweries, distilleries and roasteries (I&apos;ve personally never been to a sales meeting where beer or coffee wasn&apos;t served freshly brewed).</p><p>Next Steps</p><p>Please submit something awesome to JasonCEO@Gastrograph.com to apply.<span>
