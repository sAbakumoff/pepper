The Climate Corporation<p><a href="http://www.climate.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.climate.com</a></p><p>We have offices in San Franscisco, Seattle, Chicago, and Saint Louis, onsite only.</p><p>We&apos;re looking for senior software engineers (10+ years.)
We have a lot of Clojure and some Scala here, any FP experience is good though.
There&apos;s also a lot of Python, Ruby, and R laying around, but mostly just legacy stuff.
We handle a lot of data, experience handling a lot of data or distributed systems is a big plus.
We&apos;re processing satellite imagery for many states every day, all in AWS.</p><p>Fair warning, our parent company is Monsanto, and some people might have an issue with that.  On the upside, you&apos;ll get to work with for-real scientists on a daily basis and Monsanto has excellent benefits.  And we have lots of for-real paying customers.</p><p>Please email me at chris.gore@climate.com if you are interested, thanks.<span>
