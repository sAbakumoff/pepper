Pixlee | San Francisco, Toronto | Full Time | ONSITE<p>Pixlee is revolutionizing the relationship between people and brands. We help companies leverage customer photos/videos from social media to improve marketing.</p><p>We work with over 100+ customers, including top brands such as Converse, Kenneth Cole, UGG Australia, Mattel, Charlotte Russe, Marriott Hotels, and AMC Theatres, to drive higher online conversion, increase performance of owned media, and create a more authentic brand experience. A graduate of the Stanford StartX accelerator, Pixlee is an Andreessen Horowitz and XSeed Capital portfolio company. As a rapidly growing startup, we are constantly looking for talented people to join the Pixlee team and to help us revolutionize the intersection of big data and social media. At Pixlee we work hard, love to learn, and value teamwork and humility. We&#x2019;ve got a big vision and we&#x2019;re looking for game changers to join our team.</p><p>We look for talented, high-potential individuals who aren&#x2019;t jerks. Our proposition to them is simple: Pixlee offers a unique opportunity to thrive and grow rapidly in a small-team startup environment operating at big-company scale. Our customers are some of the largest brands in the world and everything you do here affects millions of consumers.</p><p>We believe in using the right technology for the task, and we use a mix of rails, backbone, python, scala, elasticsearch, and postgres.</p><p>For me, I&apos;ve really felt that I&apos;ve been able to really grow very rapidly, and also been given the autonomy to make many decisions you can&apos;t make at a much larger startup. Its a very tight knit group, and we like to have fun.</p><p>What we&apos;re looking for:
