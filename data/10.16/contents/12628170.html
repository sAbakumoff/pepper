San Francisco - Streak (<a href="https://www.streak.com/careers" rel="nofollow">https://www.streak.com/careers</a>) | Profitable and growing | Tech Leads (Backend, Mobile and Front-End) | ONSITE | H1-B Transfers welcome<p>Here are the hard problems you&apos;ll work on here at Streak:</p><p>Sales Autopilot</p><p>We want to do for salespeople what autopilot did for pilots. We will suggest to sales professionals the actions they need to take next to close deals. They&apos;ll instead need to monitor our &quot;autopilot&quot; system and manually override only when needed. Unlike most AI startups, we can actually build this - we have 100M+ datapoints of sales professionals manually closing deals to make the training actually possible.</p><p>Email Graphs</p><p>We&apos;re building systems to better understand how organizations communicate with one another. Email is currently siloed into individual user inboxes, we&apos;re building a graph database containing every email message in our users&apos; inboxes to give them insights into how their company communicates with their customers.</p><p>Reverse Engineer Gmail</p><p>We strive for deep integration with Gmail, because that&apos;s where our users live. Our integration has to be seamless, deep, performant, resilient and secure. It&apos;s such a hard problem, even our competitors use our tech (InboxSDK). We&apos;re doing it next for Inbox, Calendar, and more.</p><p>Outside of the hard problems you&apos;ll also have a very large impact, not just on our organization but on our customers. We have the best of both worlds: we&apos;re small (6 eng) so no meetings and other big company BS, but are profitable (millions in revenue) with a wide variety of customers that use Streak everyday for hours at a time.</p><p>Tech Stack:</p><p>Backend is 80% Java and 20% Go (and growing) on Google App Engine (<a href="https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2015/04/Streaks-Top-6-T..." rel="nofollow">https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2015/04/Streaks-Top-6-T...</a>) and Compute Engine. Front-end is React + in-house framework for handling data synchronization. Full automated end-to-end test coverage of all our features along with a growing set of unit tests to handle edge cases. If it&apos;s green you can deploy with confidence (we do many deploys per day).<span>
