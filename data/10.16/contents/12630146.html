10x Genomics | Pleasanton &amp; San Francisco, CA | Onsite | 10xgenomics.com<p>We&apos;re a biotech company creating novel software, chemistry, and microfluidic systems to allow better understanding of the genome. While DNA sequencing technology has advanced rapidly, currently it&#x2019;s still at a level equivalent to what assembly was to computing, with huge advances yet to be made. 10x Genomics is creating products that will do for sequencing what C did for computing. We&apos;re bringing a leap in higher-order clarity and meaning to what is now very low-level information. Software is a key part of that leap. The scale and complexity of analyzing, managing, and visualizing sequencing data means that this is an area with no shortage of hard problems, where engineering still matters and can yield big payoffs. Our software and instruments are used at top research institutions and hospitals around the world. 10x Genomics has most recently raised a $55M Series C from Fidelity and SoftBank and has about 120 employees in Pleasanton, San Francisco, and in the field across the world.</p><p>You can view a demo of our existing software at <a href="http://loupe.10xgenomics.com/loupe/" rel="nofollow">http://loupe.10xgenomics.com/loupe/</a>, or read about our pipelines at <a href="http://software.10xgenomics.com" rel="nofollow">http://software.10xgenomics.com</a>. We manage our pipelines with Go, develop analysis code using the NumPy stack, and drive our front-end applications with React/Redux (previously Angular 1), but we&apos;re always open to any technology that allows us to develop faster. No previous biological experience is required; we have plenty of folks here to handle that, but there is a lot to learn about if you&apos;re curious. You&apos;ll be directly working with a team of six other engineers (one of them being myself).</p><p>We&apos;re currently hiring for several software roles, but specifically for senior generalists, senior UI engineers, and a senior engineer in test. Our computational biology group is also always looking for bioinformaticians who are experienced with NGS, and our company is always looking for scientists and engineers (hardware included). Here are two of the job postings we have up, but feel free to email me if you think you&apos;re a good fit for another role.</p><p>* Senior Software Engineer - <a href="http://www.10xgenomics.com/careers/274521/" rel="nofollow">http://www.10xgenomics.com/careers/274521/</a></p><p>* Senior UI Engineer - <a href="http://www.10xgenomics.com/careers/274522/" rel="nofollow">http://www.10xgenomics.com/careers/274522/</a></p><p>Our full page of job listings can be found at <a href="http://www.10xgenomics.com/careers/" rel="nofollow">http://www.10xgenomics.com/careers/</a>.
