NStack | London, UK | Full time | Onsite | Functional Developers<p>We&#x2019;re a building a &quot;Cloud OS&quot; for composable microservices using a mixture of Haskell and Linux systems technology (including containers, systemd, dbus), with some typed DSLs, systems code, and distributed systems thrown in. We want developers to spend more time writing core business-logic vs. writing infrastructure, and are using lessons from building programming languages and operating systems to accomplish this.</p><p>We&#x2019;re looking for talented programmers -- preferably with some knowledge of typed functional languages and *NIX systems programming -- to join our small tech team to make this a reality. It&#x2019;s a challenging role, working on hard problems, but the chance to work with a top technical team and shape a company and product from an early stage.</p><p>We&#x2019;re funded by top-tier infrastructure investors from the West Coast, and the founders are both technical and ex-YC / academia. Salaries are competitive and include generous stock options. EU applicants welcome (other visas potentially possible), although roles are onsite only.</p><p>We&#x2019;re looking at a range of positions and experience levels - whether you&#x2019;ve just left uni or been hacking for 20 years, if you&#x2019;re interested please get in touch.
