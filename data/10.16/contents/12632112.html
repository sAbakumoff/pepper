I&apos;ll post to this thread because this is very relevant for the hiring companies. Hunter and Schmidt did a meta-study of 85 years of research on hiring criteria. [1]
There are three attributes you need to select for to identify performing employees in intellectual fields.<p><pre><code>  - General mental ability (Are they generally smart)
    Use WAIS or if there are artifacts of GMA(Complex work they&apos;ve done themselves) available use them as proxies. 
    Using IQ is mostly illegal[2] in the US, so you&apos;ll have to find a test that acts as a good proxy.

  - Work sample test. NOT HAZING! As close as possible to the actual work they&apos;d be doing. Try to make it apples-to-apples comparison across candidates. Also, try and make accomidations for candidates not knowing your company shibboleth.

  - Integrity. The first two won&apos;t matter if you hire  a sociopath.

     There are existing tests available for this, you can purchase for &lt; $50 per use.</code></pre>
This alone will get you &gt; 65% hit rate [1], and can be done inside of three hours. There&apos;s no need for day long (or multi-day) gladiator style gauntlets.</p><p>[1] <a href="http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%20Validity%20and%20Utility%20Psychological%20Bulletin.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%...</a></p><p>[2] The illegality comes from IQ tests disadvantaging certain minority groups.</p><p>[3] Yes, I&apos;m currently taking freelance work.<span>
