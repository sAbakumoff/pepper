Binti [<a href="https://binti.com/" rel="nofollow">https://binti.com/</a>] | San Francisco, CA | Full-time, onsite<p>Binti makes software that is transforming child welfare services administration. We work together in SF and are growing rapidly.</p><p>Binti&apos;s main SaaS web product is a conventional monolithic Rails/Postgres app that delivers value in heaps and heaps, and remains super fun to hack on. We&apos;re building the monolith up higher and higher, and looking forward to soon chipping off a service or two (perhaps in Elixir?). Specific engineering roles we have open are for someone that is highly-opinionated on the front-end stack/practices, a security specialist, and a UX/a11y specialist. We&apos;re using Kubernetes/Google Cloud.
