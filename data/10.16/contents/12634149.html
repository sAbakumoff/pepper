The Farmer&apos;s Dog is a VC backed direct-to-consumer pet food company. We&apos;re building a subscription based e-commerce platform to support and manage custom plans. Our aim is to make the subscription work to our customer&apos;s advantage. We offer ridiculous amounts of flexibility to pause, delay, reroute and switch between recipes. We&apos;ve been cashflow positive from day 1 and are growing faster than expected.
We&apos;re looking for a Software Engineer with 3+ years of experience building and delivering products to join our small and quickly growing team. Our stack is react (and redux), node, postgres, docker and aws.
