Convoy | Seattle | Onsite | Full-time<p>We&apos;re optimizing the trucking and logistics industry; automating what is, today, a $749B industry that still runs on fax machines and phone calls. Currently backed by top tier investors.

We&apos;ve grown a lot since then, but we still have a tight-knit, high leverage engineering team. I love arriving at the office in the morning - I get to work with some of the smartest folks I&apos;ve ever met, and not just in engineering. We also have a fantastic sales/operations/brokerage team, and we work with them constantly to build best-of-breed logistics automation.</p><p>We would love more engineers, up and down the stack, and anywhere on the generalist &lt;-&gt; specialist spectrum. We use pretty cutting-edge tech (React, React-Native for mobile, TypeScript + Node for backend), but we&apos;re a lot more interested in engineering chops than any particular tech skills.</p><p>If you&apos;re in Seattle, reach out and grab coffee with me or one of our other engineers. The last 18 months have been a wild ride, but we have years and years ahead of us to build a logistics titan!</p><p>All our open jobs: <a href="https://convoy.com/about.html#jobs" rel="nofollow">https://convoy.com/about.html#jobs</a><span>
