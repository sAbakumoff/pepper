Karr Lab (<a href="http://www.karrlab.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.karrlab.org</a>) @ Mount Sinai Medical School | New York, NY 10029 | Full-Time | ONSITE<p>The Karr Lab at the Institute for Genomics &amp; Multiscale Biology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is seeking talented, ambitious engineers to develop technology for building, simulating, and applying cutting-edge whole-cell computational models of individual cells.</p><p>We are developing whole-cell computational models which comprehensively predict how behavior emerges from the molecular level by representing all of the biochemical activity inside cells. Our goal is to use whole-cell models to transform bioengineering and medicine into rigorous, quantitative disciplines. Our work is highly interdisciplinary, involving systems biology, genomics, bioinformatics, data integration, parallel simulation, optimization, software engineering, and data visualization, and highly team-oriented.</p><p>We are looking for software engineers to develop several technologies, including a domain-specific language for describing whole-cell models, a parallel multi-algorithmic simulator, scalable tools for visualizing and analyzing high-dimensional simulation results, and tools for handling personal `omics data.</p><p>More information: <a href="http://www.karrlab.org/join" rel="nofollow">http://www.karrlab.org/join</a> or Jonathan Karr (karr@mssm.edu)</p><p>How to apply: Send a cover letter and a CV to Jonathan Karr (karr@mssm.edu)<span>
