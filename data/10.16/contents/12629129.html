WalmartLabs | Portland, Oregon | iOS Engineer | Onsite - Relocation Expenses Provided | $100k-160k + bonus + stock<p>I&apos;m an engineer at WalmartLabs and am looking for a few good iOS engineers to help us build our iPhone app. If working at scale in a small, startup-like environment gets you out of bed in the morning, you&apos;ll probably enjoy this gig - we&apos;re one of the most downloaded apps of all time, and we serve tens of millions of users a month.</p><p>We have a nice office in the heart of downtown Portland, and serve up the usual Silicon Valley style benefits: flexible hours, four weeks of PTO plus holidays, 401k, health care, free drinks and snacks, etc. Salary is highly competitive with Bay Area salaries, and you&apos;ll get to live in Portland, which has considerably lower overhead. If you&apos;re a good fit, we&apos;ll make it work for you.</p><p>Interested?</p><p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/123996/ios-engineer-walmartlabs" rel="nofollow">https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/123996/ios-engineer-walmartla...</a> or email me (Tres Spicher) directly at tspicher@walmartlabs.com<span>
