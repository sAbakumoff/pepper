About Lever:
Lever builds software for teams to source, interview, and hire top talent. Our team strives to set a new bar for enterprise software with modern, well-designed, real-time apps. We participated in Y Combinator in summer 2012, and since then have raised $33 million. This year, we&apos;re doubling the team in size, and we&apos;re looking forward to supporting more great companies like Netflix, Eventbrite, and Lyft.<p>Under the hood, we&apos;re a technology company with a powerful open-source web framework: DerbyJS. It is the first and only open-source MVC framework that syncs all data via an Operational Transformation backend, using the same algorithm that powers Google Docs. DerbyJS is also uniquely optimized to render everything on the server as well as the client.</p><p>Openings:
