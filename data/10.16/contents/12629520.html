Blackfynn | Philadelphia | Full-Time Onsite<p>Blackfynn is a growing startup that builds software to help researchers, life scientists, and medical professionals do collaborative and team science, notably in the field of neuroscience. We&apos;re a driven, curious group wielding data science and building software that meaningfully impacts humans. Our mission is bold, our team is experienced, and our product is ambitious. We&apos;re looking for builders to help us bring it to life.</p><p>We love individuals who are curious about domains outside of the ones we normally operate in, enjoy polyglot codebases, consider themselves a generalist, and desire to work on products that make a positive impact. The bar for software in this field is, unfortunately, low. We want to change that in a massive way.</p><p>* Full Stack Engineer: <a href="https://angel.co/blackfynn/jobs/163111-full-stack-engineer" rel="nofollow">https://angel.co/blackfynn/jobs/163111-full-stack-engineer</a></p><p>* Frontend Engineer: <a href="https://angel.co/blackfynn/jobs/163112-front-end-engineer" rel="nofollow">https://angel.co/blackfynn/jobs/163112-front-end-engineer</a></p><p>We&apos;re well funded and have excellent traction on a number of significant partnerships.
