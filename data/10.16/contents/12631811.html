Recursion Pharmaceuticals | SLC, Utah | Onsite, full-time<p>Recursion is a startup with about 20 people, but we generate rich biological data at a pace comparable to the biggest institutions anywhere doing biology and disease research. &#x200B;We have literally millions of images from experiments we conducted in our lab, and we generate terabytes more each week. We&#x2019;ve gotten more than $2M in multiple grants from the NIH, and last month closed a $13M series A led by Lux Capital. We&#x2019;re using imaging experiments to turn human cell experiments into massive amounts of rich biological data so we can find treatments for many diseases as fast as possible.</p><p>Hiring:</p><p>* Software engineering: Full-stack Software Engineer - Front-end Software Engineer - Machine Learning Engineer - VP / Director of Engineering - Engineering Product Manager - Data Engineer</p><p>* Data science: Research Data Scientist - Deep Learning Computational Scientist - Data Scientist - Computational biologist / bioinformatics</p><p><a href="http://www.recursionpharma.com/careers" rel="nofollow">http://www.recursionpharma.com/careers</a> for more details and to apply. Blake (CTO) and Ashwin (lead engineer) get notified immediately.</p><p>Logistics: Salt Lake City, Utah. Hiking/running/biking is literally out our back door, and it&apos;s half an hour to 5 ski resorts. Competitive pay, health insurance, relocation assistance (onsite is required), equity, a top-caliber team, and help make a massively positive impact. Happy to sponsor/extend visas, but you need to already be authorized to work in the US--we can&#x2019;t handle the lottery at this stage.</p><p>Tech: Data science: python scientific stack (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, bokeh, etc). Software engineering: go, python, angular.js, react, javascript on aws and gce. Deep learning (e.g. convolutional networks) we&apos;re mainly using the python frameworks (keras, theano, tensorflow, etc).</p><p>Our team of ~20: <a href="http://www.recursionpharma.com/team" rel="nofollow">http://www.recursionpharma.com/team</a><span>
