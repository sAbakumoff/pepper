Weissmaler | Berlin, Germany | ONSITE | Full time<p>Looking for a Lead Developer (JavaScript) who wants to paint it black!</p><p>WEISSMALER is Germany&#x2019;s first tech-driven painting company. Our ambition is to build
the largest and best painting company in Germany, using technological innovation to manage
our painters better and more efficiently than traditional painting companies.</p><p>We are looking for an experienced developer who likes the challenge of building up a tech stack from
scratch (well, almost). We&#x2019;re talking about customer-facing applications that allow for accurate pricing and
generating quotes, as well as tools to manage painters, automatically order materials, and communicate
effectively with painters and customers. So far we only did the groundwork for some of these tools, so there
is a lot of freedom to build and design. Our current stack is based on NodeJS, Express, RethinkDB, React and Redux.</p><p>In addition to building software, we are also looking for someone who can build teams. You will be the first
employed developer in our team, and we want you to bring your most talented friends. We will immediately
look for one junior developer to complement your skillset and build up a larger team in the next months.</p><p>WHAT DO WE OFFER?</p><p>As our lead developer, you will have the freedom to shape the technological direction of our company. It will
be up to you to choose what we will develop, how we do it, and what our tech team will look like. The
choices you make will have a major impact on our business, team and success. We offer &#x20AC;40-60k salary plus equity (up to 3%).
An awesome team of young and ambitious people to work with and a great office in Neuk&#xF6;lln.</p><p>If you are interested you can mail me through my profile or directly to HR at jobs@weissmaler.de<span>
