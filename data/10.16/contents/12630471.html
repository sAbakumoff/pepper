- We value diversity of thought, being and experience.
- Dogs welcome.
- A fully stocked pantry, and an actual kitchen.</p><p>Full JDs on AngelList -- <a href="https://angel.co/masonamerica/jobs" rel="nofollow">https://angel.co/masonamerica/jobs</a></p><p>Unfortunately we&apos;re unable to handle H1Bs at the moment.</p><p>WHERE?
