Back-end engineers | Alar Software | Chicago, IL | Full-Time ONSITE | 80K + &amp; options based on experience, paid parking, stocked kitchen &amp; doggy (doggy not edible)<p>Please email resumes to hiring@alar.net</p><p>We&#x2019;re aiming to aggregate logistics data to enable customers to operate more efficiently and connect them with other logistics companies. We believe we&#x2019;re on to something big, but to get there we&#x2019;re working through end-to-end complex problems in a complex and old-fashioned domain. We&#x2019;re taking an unconventional approach (event sourcing with a twist and a touch of farmville) and dealing with big data to boot.</p><p>Because of this complexity, we&apos;re limiting our search to two kinds of people: experienced engineers who can bring structure to the chaos as we grow, or those applicants who can make up for lack of experience with passion and creativity. Please don&apos;t apply unless you can demonstrate one of these somehow.</p><p><i>Back-end stack:</i> Migrating from C# to Scala. Also a bit of postgres, some simple mongo for non-critical functions, and ASP.NET.<span>
