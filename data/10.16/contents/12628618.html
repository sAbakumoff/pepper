ZALORA | Singapore | ONSITE, REMOTE, VISA
ZALORA is an online fashion retailer headquartered in Singapore with millions of customers and 1000+ employees throughout South East Asia. We&apos;re expanding our globally distributed DevOps team.
You will be using Nix/NixOS to glue together a stack of Go, Memcached, MySQL, PHP, Solr and more.
A code check (either an existing project or a test) is the biggest deciding factor. After that we&apos;ll chat, call and optionally meet to sort out the details.
