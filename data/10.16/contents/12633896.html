Iterable (<a href="https://iterable.com" rel="nofollow">https://iterable.com</a>) - San Francisco, CA - ONSITE<p>Come join Iterable. We&apos;re 29 people bringing the growth hacking tools that consumer internet companies like Google/Twitter/Facebook build internally to other large-scale companies. We aim to build the best user growth engine on the planet. It&apos;s crazy how messaging and email usage are changing, but the technology and capabilities haven&apos;t caught up to the 21st century.</p><p>Our team of hackers and thinkers is from quant finance/Twitter/Google/Yahoo/Zynga/Khan Academy/Palantir/CMU/MIT, (we built large parts of Twitter&apos;s growth systems). One of our top level goals is to build a uniquely fun and growth oriented company culture. Knowledge sharing in any capacity is highly valued here -- are you interested in prediction markets or PGP encryption? Do you enjoy teaching posture techniques or purely functional data structures to others? We pair program, design together, and generally create a learn-and-teach environment here. This is an opportunity to join a super-fast growing startup, in a huge market and with a great team, while it&apos;s still early.</p><p>If you&apos;re interested in coming on board, you can help with some challenges we face:</p><p><pre><code>  - Scale our messaging API
  - Design and write performant, beautiful, asynchronous interfaces 
  - Write software to build machine learned user models 
  - Make data visualizations for our email and user data 
  - Design an immutable deployment infrastructure for our platform</code></pre>
Some aspects of our culture that make us different:</p><p><pre><code>  - We are all very focused on self improvement 
  - Our company has egalitarian and transparent values (work when you want, on what you want) 
  - We are chill &amp; empathetic people 
  - The company is completely transparent</code></pre>
Technologies you&apos;ll work with:</p><p><pre><code>  - Scala
  - Elasticsearch
  - Postgres
  - Redis
  - ES6
  - AngularJS
  - Play Framework
  - RabbitMQ
</code></pre>
You&apos;ll get to work with us at our new office at 3rd &amp; Harrison in San Francisco.
