Pathgather - <a href="http://pathgather.com" rel="nofollow">http://pathgather.com</a> - ONSITE - New York, NY (NYC)<p>At Pathgather, we believe that learning matters and that modern companies can&apos;t afford to provide the same tired, low-quality experiences they&apos;ve been using for the last few decades. Our enterprise learning platform is used by some of the largest companies in the world like Qualcomm, Walmart, and Twitter to help their employees find great learning content from any source, share knowledge with their peers, and track their progress towards career goals - and we&apos;ve wrapped it all up into an experience that employees actually love to use.</p><p>We&apos;re growing in a big way and are looking for experienced engineers to join our team to help make enterprise learning better. Our stack is React + React Native + Relay + GraphQL + Roda + Sequel + Postgres + etc.</p><p>* BACKEND ENGINEER (Ruby), $100-130k, 0.1-0.5%, <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/pathgather/e700098b-b552-4b10-a5a5-e0e1e49a4154?lever-source=hn" rel="nofollow">https://jobs.lever.co/pathgather/e700098b-b552-4b10-a5a5-e0e...</a></p><p>* FRONTEND ENGINEER (React), $100-130k, 0.1-0.5%, <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/pathgather/8a543314-5444-468c-85ce-3ede0320f0af?lever-source=hn" rel="nofollow">https://jobs.lever.co/pathgather/8a543314-5444-468c-85ce-3ed...</a></p><p>If you&apos;re interested, contact neville@pathgather.com, talk to us on AngelList, leave a comment here... etc.<span>
