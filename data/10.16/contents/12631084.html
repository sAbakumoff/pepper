Microsoft is hiring, we&apos;ve got a lot of openings world wide.<p><a href="https://careers.microsoft.com/" rel="nofollow">https://careers.microsoft.com/</a></p><p>I have worked here for 8+ years now and I have to say its a really amazing company to work for. If you don&apos;t know about Microsoft culture, we&apos;ve got a ton of smart people and the atmosphere supports people through the good and bad times in their life, while enabling them to be successful.</p><p>The only thing worth noting is that most of the jobs at Microsoft when it comes to &quot;build products&quot; tends to be in Redmond, WA. We do have dev centers in other places like our ALM group in NC, or Xamarin mobile team in Boston, but again I just mean &quot;majority&quot; not all when I say &quot;Redmond&quot; :).<span>
