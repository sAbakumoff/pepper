Inventables | Chicago, IL | ONSITE<p>My employer, Inventables, is hiring software engineers and graphic designers. We make and sell CNC carving machines for schools, libraries, makerspaces, and home users. We write software for every step of the process, from creating a design to driving the machine. That means there&apos;s a huge variety of technical challenges and design challenges.</p><p>If you&apos;re a programmer or designer who spends their evenings working with powertools or Aduinos, we definitely want to talk with you. If you don&apos;t even know what CNC is, but the idea of working on software to educate and enable the next generation of makers is exciting to you, we want to talk to you as well.</p><p>I&apos;ve been working here for several months, and every Monday, I wake up excited for another week of working here. If you&apos;re in Chicago (or thinking of moving here), and you want to know the details of why, hit me up.<span>
