Toronto, Canada | Kira Systems | REMOTE ok | Clojure/ClojureScript Web Developer<p>Kira Inc. is a Toronto-based startup using machine learning to automate legal work. We&#x2019;re looking for a developer to work on our Clojure and ClojureScript web application. Our stack includes reactive single-page web client code and a distributed backend to handle internal computations. Our team is small, pragmatic, and inquisitive; we love learning new technologies and balance adoption with good analysis. To us, agile is a verb, not a noun, we adopt what works for us rather than strictly following a particular methodology. We prefer to hire near our downtown Toronto office, but also welcome remote applicants.</p><p>This position is focused on internal tools such as application analytics and internal integrations. It involves a bit of everything in the web stack:</p><p><pre><code>  * Client-side UI code.
  * Server-side REST routes.
  * Platform and core APIs.
  * Document and report generation.
</code></pre>
You should have knowledge of some of these. Most of all we look for those interested in learning.</p><p>Please send us:</p><p><pre><code>  * cover letter &#x2014; tell us why you&#x2019;re interested,
  * resume/linkedin profile,
  * link to github projects or other work samples.
</code></pre>
If we like the look of what you send us, we&apos;ll ask you to perform a short take-home coding test, and if that is satisfactory, we&apos;ll invite to an interview with the team.</p><p>Please apply online at <a href="https://kirasystems.com/careers#op-131123-clojureclojurescript-web-developer" rel="nofollow">https://kirasystems.com/careers#op-131123-clojureclojurescri...</a><span>
