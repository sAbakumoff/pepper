Ravel Law (<a href="http://ravellaw.com" rel="nofollow">http://ravellaw.com</a>) | San Francisco | Full-time | Onsite<p>Ravel Law is a new legal search, analytics, and visualization platform. Ravel enables lawyers to find, contextualize, and interpret information that turns legal data into legal insights. Ravel&apos;s array of powerful tools &#x2013; which include data-driven, interactive visualizations and analytics &#x2013; transforms how lawyers understand the law and prepare for litigation. In today&apos;s global and increasingly digital world, Ravel empowers attorneys to benefit from this huge influx of information and find value in it.</p><p>In 2012, Ravel spun out of Stanford University&apos;s Law School, Computer Science Department, and d.school, with the support of CodeX (Stanford&apos;s Center for Legal Informatics).</p><p>We&apos;re looking for an experienced front-end engineer. We build our front-end in Ember using Ember-CLI, ES6 transpilers, ember-data, and http-mocks for rapid and modern development. Ideal candidates will be skilled in highly dynamic web interface development (HTML, JavaScript, AJAX, jQuery). In addition, candidates should have a passion for engineering unique interactive visualizations with d3.js and potentially canvas/webGL. A flexible front-end engineer with 3-5 years JavaScript experience will excel in this role, but 2+ years professional Ember experience will also distinguish leading candidates.</p><p><a href="https://jobs.lever.co/ravel/73e5b4a3-7732-4369-8b3a-d82c934f97c2" rel="nofollow">https://jobs.lever.co/ravel/73e5b4a3-7732-4369-8b3a-d82c934f...</a><span>
