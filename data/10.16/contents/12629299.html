This includes engineers with experience applying design patterns to their code (Module, Sandbox, etc.), implementing modularization, writing unit tests, and optimizing performance.</p><p>We think it&#x2019;s especially awesome if you have experience with modern JavaScript libraries, such as React.js (what we use), Backbone.js, Angular.js, Ember.js, Polymer.js, etc. You will work in a highly collaborative, cross-functional, and Agile team and may take a lead role on various software components.</p><p>We&#x2019;re also big on fun. It&#x2019;s not uncommon to spontaneously jump into a table tennis match. Plus, every Friday we eat and drink together.</p><p>Please email hn@repspark.com with applications or questions. We&apos;d love to hear from you!<span>
