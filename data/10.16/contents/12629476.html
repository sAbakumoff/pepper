PayPal | San Jose, CA | Onsite (relocation available) | Hiring Javascript Application Engineers<p>PayPal is looking for JavaScript engineers who want to work both in the browser and on the server-side in Node.js. Over the past couple of years, we&apos;ve worked hard to migrate our entire web application stack to Node and powerful client-side apps and we&apos;re looking to turn the dial towards product experimentation and innovation. We need your engineering ability and your desire to be a part of the whole product!</p><p>I&#x2019;m a manager on the Online Checkout (that&#x2019;s the &#x201C;Pay with PayPal&#x201D; button and experience) engineering team. We&apos;re looking for experienced JavaScript developers. My team is currently working primarily with Angular on the client and Kraken on Node. If you&apos;ve got experience with React, we&apos;re actively exploring doing an inside-out migration of our application and could use your expertise. As most Node shops go, we&apos;re leveraging a whole lot of other open source tools as well and we&apos;re very supportive of open source activities for our people.</p><p>We have several openings within my team as well as within other teams--so drop me a line even if my particular opening doesn&apos;t sound interesting and I&apos;ll help you find the right place!
