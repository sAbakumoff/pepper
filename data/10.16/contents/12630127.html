Front-End Developer | HigherMe (YC W2015) | <a href="https://higherme.com" rel="nofollow">https://higherme.com</a> | Boston, MA  | ONSITE | Full-time<p>HigherMe is removing the grind of finding and staffing hourly jobs. Job-seekers only have to fill out one application for thousands of jobs positions. They don&#x2019;t even have to apply for jobs themselves as employers can reach out instead. Our platform helps both sides in this process with features like text-to-apply and job interview scheduling while employers can easily keep track of applicants all the way to the on-boarding process.</p><p>Our engineering department is looking for a junior/mid-level front-end developer to help us roll-out the multitude of features we have planned. We work in a pretty standard React.js/Webpack stack with Alt.js providing our flux implementation. We&#x2019;re looking for someone who has made something interesting with React on the side and understands their way around a single page app.</p><p>We&#x2019;ll start the interview process with a phone interview followed by coming into the office.</p><p>Apply at Angelist: <a href="https://angel.co/higherme/jobs/100150-frontend-developer" rel="nofollow">https://angel.co/higherme/jobs/100150-frontend-developer</a><span>
