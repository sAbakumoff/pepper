Collective Health, ( <a href="https://collectivehealth.com/jobs/" rel="nofollow">https://collectivehealth.com/jobs/</a> ), San Francisco (very near caltrain), CA (Full time, ONSITE only, VISA case-by-case, see below)<p>We&apos;re replacing health insurance with a system that members love. Using our SW, platform and services, an employer can pay doctors directly, saving a ton of money and making the employee experience amazing (with the testimonials to back it up). The company is well-funded, ~two and a half years old and growing very rapidly with sales traction. We punch well above our weight-class with experienced founders, ~250 team members (~ one quarter is engineering), and paying customers.
Our tech stack is a mix of Go and Java components with Angular on the front end. We use a custom service bus to tie our SOA together, microservices style. We love Docker, CoreOS, postgres, automated testing, and continuos integration. We&apos;ve got some neat in-house tools for service discovery, health checks, cluster setup and deploy and more.</p><p>As a company, we&apos;re strong believers in transparency, trust and balance. As an engineering team, we believe good code is easy to read and should have a short &quot;time to understanding&quot;. We expect all of our engineers to continually teach as well as learn. We also believe that everyone should write good code, yet balance that against the need to ship.</p><p>We&apos;ve got a ton of interesting problems to solve around distributed systems, data analytics and predictions, complex data modeling, ultra high-availability, security, privacy and more.</p><p>We&apos;re currently looking for experienced SW engineers up and down the stack. Our biggest needs are DevOps and Backend Engineers.
