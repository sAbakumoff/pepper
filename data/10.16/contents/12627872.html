Nava | Washington DC &amp; San Francisco SF | DevOps/Infrastructure/Systems Engineers, Software/Fullstack Engineers, Frontend Engineers| On-site - Full-time | $100k-$160k + equity<p>We&apos;re a small team of engineers, designers, and product builders that were brought in to help fix Healthcare.gov in the winter of 2013. Our revamped application is used by millions, converts 35% better, and halves the completion time.</p><p>It turns out there&#x2019;s a lot more to reimagine within government services, which is why we&#x2019;re partnering with the Department of Veterans Affairs to modernize their appeals system, making millions of veteran&#x2019;s lives better through the process. Today, the average appeal takes 5 years to process; we can fix this.</p><p>It&#x2019;s surprising how much can be done by a small group of empathetic people with a Silicon Valley mindset, deep technical experience, working closely with dedicated civil servants in government.</p><p>We&#x2019;ve started Nava as a public benefit corporation to radically improve how our government serves its people, and we believe that the services our government provides should be clear and reliable.
