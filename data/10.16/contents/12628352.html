Smartcar API | Frontend, Backend | Mountain View | Onsite Only | <a href="https://smartcar.com/" rel="nofollow">https://smartcar.com/</a><p>I&apos;m one of the first employees at Smartcar. I joined about a year ago after parting ways with a $3M VC-backed startup I cofounded 5 years ago. A lot of startups have great teams and investors but I chose this startup because I believe that it&apos;s in the right space at the right time: transportation.</p><p>Transportation is roughly 9% of US GDP. Looking at the next 10 years of transportation, it&apos;s autonomous, electric, shared and connected. Smartcar is building the connected part.</p><p>The past 3 months have been a whirlwind. We&apos;ve brought on big deals with Fortune 500 companies and hired on 3 engineers... but we need mid-level engineering more help immediately.</p><p>If you want to learn more, email me at Martin@Smartcar.com or call me at 415 404 5650.</p><p>Our stack is Node.js, Postgres, Redis, Docker, AWS. Interview process is a phone call, take-home project and then a 2-3 hour on-site interview with all staff.</p><p>$95K to $130K + up to 1.0% equity
