BAMTech (formerly MLB Advanced Media) | NYC | Full-time | Onsite<p>BAMTech was recently spun off from MLBAM, the technology and digital media division of Major League Baseball. We provide end-to-end content and media delivery solutions over web, mobile, and connected devices. Our partners include MLB, HBO, PGA, WWE, NHL, GoPro, and more. Check out our CTO&apos;s keynote at last year&apos;s AWS Re:invent conference: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAmpZ2sk400" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAmpZ2sk400</a>.</p><p>Our headquarters is inside Chelsea Market in Manhattan. My team, Content Delivery Engineering (CDE), owns the systems that allow client applications (web, mobile, connected devices) to consume content metadata (video, photos, articles, and any other content that gets exposed to consumers) from all of our clients. We&apos;re hiring Software Engineers of all levels as we grow to take on more and more partners. The interview process consists of a 45 minute phone screen in which we do some coding online, followed by an on-site interview where you&apos;ll have four one-hour sessions with 1-2 interviewers in each session. Please shoot me an email for more info.<span>
